Image analysis based on machine learning

This repository contains source code developed at the University of Bayreuth to analyze images of time-temperature integrating colloidal arrays. The details of the data evaluation and model creation are explained in our corresponding paper (https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202205512). The raw data used for training and validation is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7464047. Preprocessed inputs and labels as well as grouping into training and validation set are uploaded as a release of this repository.
